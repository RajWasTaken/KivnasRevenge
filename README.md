Things to note:

1. The Game is hard. You have to be very careful with your searching, and use tight windows to bait Kivna to a certain position in order to get certain objectives.
	- Searching alerts Kivna to your location if he is on your floor or one floor away. He will begin following the same paths you can (except for the fact that he cannot take the dumbwaiters) to navigate to the spot in which the last search was.
	- Doing anything on the middle floor is treacherous as if he gets on the middle floor, you are doomed. Acquiring any items on the middle floor must be done with thought in mind.


The start to every winning order:

	i) Talk to Anvik (right all the way, up to the top floor, and left until Anvik’s lab)

	ii) Flip the breaker (right from Anvik’s lab, down to the basement, and one left [search the room to access the breaker])

	iii) Get access to Nicole’s room

		1. Attempt to get into Nicole’s room (2 rooms left of the furnace room)
		2. Go to the middle floor and one left to the living room
		3. Search the living room to unlock Nicole’s room
		4. Go back to Nicole’s room and talk to her.

	iv) Go right to the storage room and acquire the Rohan duck



Here is a winning order for winning by debugging (low margin of error):

	v) In order to grab Kaelan’s duck (in the kitchen), you must ensure Kivna is at least 3 moves from the staircases. You can do so by:

		1. Leading him to the middle floor if he’s not (do this by searching on the middle floor)
			▪ Going downstairs/upstairs and searching in the room next to either dumbwaiter (Anvik’s lab or Nicole’s room)
			▪ This should attract Kivna to the farthest he can be from the kitchen
			▪ Take the dumbwaiter up/down and navigate to the kitchen to grab Kaelan’s duck. You should have a small window ahead of Kivna.
