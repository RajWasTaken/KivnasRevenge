Welcome To Kivna's Revenge.


At any time you can look at your inventory, interact with your room, or get help from here. Any "physical" action can cause reactions from the game world and will end your turn.

In any given room you may be able to look around for clues, search for goodies, pick up said goodies, and interact with specific things.

Feel free to explore your environment and move around. Be careful though - some things may be noisier than others.
