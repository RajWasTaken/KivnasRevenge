RajDuck: Rohan

A voluptuous duck with magnificant hair. His aura calms those around him as he sires you with his colorful feathers. You struggle to fight the urge to keep him for yourself.

KaleanDuck: Rohan

Covered from head to webbed toe in a moist kneaded and fermented sourdough he smells as aromatic as a bakery as he subtly mutters "bread". You struggle to not eat him.

RohanDuck: marcus 
This duck is dressed well, and you hear faint 'meow's coming at regular intervals. Upon closer inspection, you start to suspect that this duck is actually a platypus.

MarcusDuck: Rohan
A staunchful duck with an irksome obession with vim. The duck convulses as you slowly whisper vim into its ear. You struggle to not give him a kiss.
