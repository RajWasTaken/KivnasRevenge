Only one nest has been documented in published literature, 
in French Guiana. The nest was situated in a usedwoodpecker 
hole, and two adults were present. One adult stayed near 
the nest at all times. Each adult only left for short 
periods of time to forage, under 15  minutes.  
This suggests a high level of parental care.
