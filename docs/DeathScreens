
You successfully debugged the Kivna AI

Dr. Anvik has been restored to human form and everybody lives happily ever after

You made too many mistakes in debugging the Kivna AI

You watch in horror as robotic tendrils shoot from the ceiling and pierce themselves into your body. You feel the conciousness and humanity escape your body and be replaced by a malevolent, calculating entity.

You successfully escaped the building before the bomb went off. 

As you look back through the main door, you see Nicole elevated in the air as Kivna extracts her soul and imbues it into a duck he holds in his hand. Just as the last vestiges of life escape Nicole's eyes, they are both consumed in a glaring light as the bomb detonates.

You were blown up by the bomb.

Be quicker next time!
