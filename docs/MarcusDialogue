Oh hello! I'm Marcus, the other intern here. 
Man, check out this project I'm working on. Once I'm done, I should be able to run Vim IN MY BRAIN! Isn't that crazy?

It's Unix based, and you can use it without ever needing to touch your mouse!
Emacs is also Unix based... but it's gross and disgusting and if you use it you will never be loved.
